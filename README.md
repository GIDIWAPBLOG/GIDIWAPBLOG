Before encountering Jesus, Simon was a fisherman. He made his living by casting nets into the Sea of Galilee, hoping to catch fish for sustenance and trade. Simon, along with his brother Andrew, worked as a fisherman in the region. Their lives changed dramatically when Jesus called them to become His disciples. They left their nets behind and followed Jesus, embarking on a new journey of faith and service. Simon’s transformation from a fisherman to an apostle highlights the profound impact that encountering Jesus had on his life.
Saint Simon the Apostle, also known as Simon the Zealot, is believed to have flourished in the 1st century AD. His exact birth date is not recorded, but he is recognized as one of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus. Simon’s epithet, Kananaios, is often misunderstood to mean “from Cana” or “from Canaan.” However, it is actually the Greek transliteration of an Aramaic word, qanʾ anaya, which means “the Zealot.” This title was given to him by Luke in the Gospel and Acts. His life is not extensively documented in the New Testament, but tradition holds that he preached the Gospel in Egypt and later joined the apostle St. Judas (Thaddaeus) in Persia. According to the apocryphal Acts of Simon and Judas, he was martyred by being cut in half with a saw, which became one of his chief iconographic symbols.
